# RubyFinal
When it came to the Original challenge I didn't have to deviate or change much at all, but I did add more. I added a second stage and I added the win/lose music as reccommended and it proved to be a success. 
In terms of the visual aspect of the game, I didn't change much if at all. As I'm writing this I am currently working on the final, so if I gained the energy to make any visual changes as opposed to gameplay changes I will note it, I also added a pickup sprite that depicts a piece of candy. I understand that points will be lost and I am willing to make that sacrifice. 
I currently did not make any audio changes from the challenge, other than adding win/lose music. I find that adding audio like footsteps and such is tedious and I am also willing to make that sacrifice as well. 
Now I made two major gameplay changes in the final and that is that I added a speed boost pickup that temporarily makes the player character run faster and I added a countdown timer to add significance to that particular gameplay change. If the countdown goes to zero the game is over and you have to try again. In the second stage I made it so that the map is consisted entirely of harder bots to fix. The countdown timer makes the game harder and gives the speed boost pickups precedent. They are needed by the player to complete the game and combined with the ammo counter it changes the verve of the game.  You have 60 seconds per stage to complete the stage or the game is over.
